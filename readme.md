# Info

This Repo contains the 2 unity projects:
- Overgrown, My actual GGJ Submission (Didn't submit due to not getting far)
- Roots, A joke GGJ Submission I did on no sleep in an hour, with the sole intent to make the most unreadable and maintainable code possible.

## Overgrown

Overgrown was intented to be a Farming Co-Op Game, with similar gameplay to Overcooked.

The main purpose of the project was to learn [Unity's Multiplayer Suite](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/), which just went to 1.0 at the time. The project uses both the Relay, Lobby, Authentication Service to achieve a lobby menu screen, and multiplayer functionality between connected players in a "Active" lobby (Where the players can run around in a gameplay like lobby). No further gameplay core was achieved.

## Roots

All I can say is ... ROOTS.

The scripts for this are cursed.
